# HonoursProjectApp - ScreenHealthAppliation
This is my Final Honours Project which is a Mobile Application that tracks how often you use your phone 
and the application this project involved creating an application that could use the android “UsageStatsManager” API to track the user’s application user.

This Application that was programmed in Java using Android studio as the IDE and 
there were are a lot of change's when developing this project such as being unable to implement the bar chart to allow user's to view their application usage view a bar chart, 
a notification system to let the user's know that they have exceeded their screen time limit and unable to implement the Google G-Mail sign up/sign in authentication.

Features that could be implemented in the future such as For the functionality side of the mobile application most of the functionality is there but some of the functionality is missing such as allowing users to view their application usage data in a more graphical view 
such as a bar chart, the ability the application to send notifications that tells the user they are spending too much time on their mobile phone, 
the Google Third Party authentication feature.
